# What is DevOps?
DevOps is a software developement approach which involves contineous developement, contineous testing, contineous integration, contineous deployment and contineous monitoring of the software throughout it's developement life-cycle.

DevOps is nothing but a practice or methodology of making "developers" and "operations" folks work together, hence the term "DevOps".

DevOps = Developement + Operations
